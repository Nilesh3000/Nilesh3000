I'm a recent graduate from BCS Bachelor's of Computer Science and a self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast. I'm passionate about learning and using technology to protect people and systems from harm.

I have completed courses from ISC2, IBM, and Virtual Cyber Academy on topics such as cybersecurity, ethical hacking, intrusion detection systems, digital forensics, information gathering, and incident response. I also have knowledge about cloud and Python coding.
